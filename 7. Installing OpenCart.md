# Installing OpenCart 

OpenCart is an online store management system. We will use Helm package manager to create OpenCart deployment on our k8s cluster. The chart creates
secrets, databases, and volume claims automatically. Implementing the OpenCart manually would take
“forever”.

We will not be using the default configurations. Instead, we will change the service type to ClusterIP and specify the FQDN to 
itstore.example.com or otherwise, we  cannot use Nginx ingress controller.

Run this command on your workstation to create this deployment

```bash
helm install my-opencart --set service.type=ClusterIP,opencartHost=itstore.example.com oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/opencart
```

This command will install all the packages necessary and make a deployment with a service named ``` my-opencart```. It is now time to configure the Nginx ingress controller to map domain name (e.g., itstore.example.com) to this service.

## Ingress ```itstore.example.com``` to the Service ```my-opencart```

1. Open the Rancher Web UI again, by searching the floating IP address of the VM ```rancher-server```.
2. Go to Home, click on the left-nav menu, and click on your cluster
