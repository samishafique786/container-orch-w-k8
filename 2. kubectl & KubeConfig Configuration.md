# kubectl and KubeConfig Configuration

After we have created the k8s cluster and registered the master & worker nodes, it is time to set up kubectl on our local workstation with the help of the KubeConfig file.

`kubectl` is a command-line tool for managing Kubernetes clusters. `kubeconfig` is a configuration file used by kubectl to connect to clusters securely. When we confire kubectl on our local Ubuntu workstation, we will be able to manage and operate our Kubernetes resources, such as deploying applications, managing pods, scaling deployments, and troubleshooting issues from our local machine.

## Installing kubectl on Local Workstation (Ubuntu 20.04)

Before installing kubectl on our local machine, we need to first check the version of kubectl that is running on the Rancher server, so that both versions match. Head to the Rancher Web UI, 

1. Click â˜° > Cluster Management.
2. Go to the cluster you want to access with kubectl and click Explore.
3. At the top, click the Kubectl Shell button. ![image](https://github.com/samishafique786/container-orch-w-k8s/assets/108603607/a188e493-1227-457d-b3f3-77a462d9b29e)
Run the command ``` kubectl version ``` and it will show you the kubectl version, as in the screenshot below.

Now that we know what version of kubectl to install, we can use the following command on your local workstation install kubectl.

On Linux x86-64, type: ```bash curl -LO https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.27.8/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl ```
On Linux ARM64, type: ```bash curl -LO https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.27.8/bin/linux/arm64/kubectl ```
