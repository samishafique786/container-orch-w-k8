# kubectl and KubeConfig Configuration

After we have created the k8s cluster and registered the master & worker nodes, it is time to set up kubectl on our local workstation with the help of the KubeConfig file.

`kubectl` is a command-line tool for managing Kubernetes clusters. `kubeconfig` is a configuration file used by kubectl to connect to clusters securely. When we confire kubectl on our local Ubuntu workstation, we will be able to manage and operate our Kubernetes resources, such as deploying applications, managing pods, scaling deployments, and troubleshooting issues from our local machine.
