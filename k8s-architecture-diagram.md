# K8sviz and Drawing Kubernetes Architectural Diagrams
For further understanding of our Kubernetes cluster, I used a tool called 'k8sviz' from this [repository.]([url](https://github.com/mkimuram/k8sviz#bash-script-version-1)https://github.com/mkimuram/k8sviz#bash-script-version-1).
With k8sviz, you can easily understand the relationships between your deployments, pods, services, and other resources, all presented in a clear and informative diagram.

Since we have deployed multiple containers and different services with ingress, the understanding of how everything is connected is crucial.

# Prerequisites for K8sviz

### A running Kubernetes cluster
### kubectl configured to access your cluster

## Installation:

```There are two ways to install k8sviz: Bash Script Version & Pre-Built Binary // I used the bash script version.```
